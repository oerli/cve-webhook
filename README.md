# cve-webhook
This scripts informs you via a Webhook (eg. Microsoft Teams) if there is a new CVE in the cvedetails.com Database, for products or vendors you have specified.

## Run as Scheduled Task
This program should run as cron job/scheduled task. For now the Path are fixed, you would need to specify the run path where the templates and cfg folders located. As well messagecard.json.tera is a fixed path.

## Example configuration
In the ./cfg folder specify the cvedb.yaml file which contains the product and vendor id's from cvedetails.com. The name can be a descriptive text/title for each id, the title is not used for lookups:
```yaml
products:
  - name: "VMWare Horizon"
    id: 61509
  - name: "VMWare Horizon Client"
    id: 31847

vendors:
  - name: "Veeam"
    id: 15994
```

In the webhook.yaml configuration is the url for the Webhook URL and the days attribute is to specify how often the cron job/schduled task should run, or it defines how many days back it should check for updated CVE's. The template defines the main template file to use inside the templates folder:
```yaml
url: "https://xxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/xxx"
days: 1
template: messagecard.json.tera
```
